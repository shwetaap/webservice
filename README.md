# Webserver Application

This is Webserver application implementing REST API calls to manipulate Objects

---
## API Specification

The sample http request looks like this

GET "/objects/{bucket}/{objectID}"

PUT "/objects/{bucket}/{objectID}" -d '{data":"obj"}

DELETE "/objects/{bucket}/{objectID}"

Data is stored in memory using the Object Strut. These Objects are distributed and stored in multiple buckets
